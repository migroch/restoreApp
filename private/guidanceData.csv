Four-Points,Assumptions,"• The  pandemic  has  intensified  equity  issues.  The  coronavirus  exposed  and  exacerbated  the inequalities in our society and education systems.  As students return to school, we have a rare opportunity to promote equity by prioritizing resources — people, time, and money — for schools serving vulnerable students.  Leaders will have many new challenges and decisions to make as we move to a new normal.  Limited resources from budget cuts will put additional pressure on districts to do more with less.  We believe that by examining who benefits from each policy and program decision — and who is left out — more equitable outcomes can prevail.",A1,,,,,,1
Four-Points,Assumptions,"• For many students, schools are not only a place for a traditional education, but also the place where their basic needs are met.  The coronavirus made clear the important role that schools play in providing food, counseling, and many other basic supports for students and families.  Leaders can realize their goals for supporting the whole child by building an infrastructure at the central office and in schools to coordinate with community organizations to provide wrap-in and wrap- around services.  Pairing this with enhanced social and emotional learning practices will ready students for active learning.",A2,,,,,,1
Four-Points,Assumptions,"• Every student needs access to a computer or tablet and the internet. If the coronavirus pandemic has taught us anything, it is that adequate technology — each student having a device and access to the internet — is essential to ensuring continuity of learning and addressing equity challenges.
